# London_Bike_Sharing_Python_Tableau
This project explores the London Bike Sharing dataset through both data analysis and visualization. It aims to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights related to bike rental behavior across the city.

**Files Included**
*London Bike Sharing.ipynb*
→ A Jupyter Notebook that handles data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling.
**Main tasks:**
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation analysis
- Building simple predictive models

**London Bike Sharing.twbx**
→ A Tableau Workbook for interactive data visualization.
**Main dashboards and visualizations:**
- Temporal trends in bike rentals (hourly, daily, seasonal)
- Impact of weather conditions on bike demand
- Correlation of rentals with temperature, humidity, and other factors

Key Insights
1. Temperature, time of day, and weather conditions strongly influence bike rental patterns.
2. Peak usage typically occurs during commuting hours and weekends.
3. Adverse weather (rain, low temperatures) significantly reduces bike usage.
